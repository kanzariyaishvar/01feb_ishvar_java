 1) what is software? what is software engineering?
 => software is a set of intrustion ,data or programes used to operate computers and excute specific tasks.
 => software engineering is detailed study of engineering to the design ,development and maintenace of software.

 2) explain types of software.
 => 1.  seystem  software
    2.  programing software
    3.  application software
    4.  middleware software
    5.  driver softwere

        1.  seystem  softwere: seystem  softwere provide the computer use basic function and computer hardwere.
        2.  programing softwere: computter programer use programing softwere to write code.programing softwere and progrraming tools enable devlopers to devlop,write,test and debug softwere programs.
        3.  Application software is the general design of computer programsfor performing user tasks.
        4.  the term middleware software that mediates between application and seystem software or  between two diffrent kinds of application software.
        5.  Driver software is help to run a system software

 3)What is SDLC? explain each phase of SDLC.
 => sotwere devlopment life cycle.
    1. Planning 
    2. Analysis
    3. Design
    4. Implementation
    5. Testing
    6. Maintenance

 => the softwere Devlopment Life Cycle refer to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-qulity softwere.in detail

 4)What is DFD create a DFD diagram of flipkart.
 => DFD-Dta flow diagrams.
 => DFD elements are:
    1. External Entity
    2. Process
    3. Data Flow 
    4. Data Store
